# 🔧 ABI File Fix - Vercel Deployment Issue Resolved

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

The Vercel build was failing because the `contract/abi.json` file was being excluded by the `.vercelignore` file, but the frontend code needs this file.

### **Error:**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../contract/abi.json'
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `.vercelignore` file was excluding the entire `contract/` directory, but the frontend components need access to `contract/abi.json`.

### **The Fix:**
Updated `.vercelignore` to:
- ✅ Keep `contract/abi.json` available for frontend
- ✅ Still exclude unnecessary contract files like `contracts/` and `hardhat.config.cjs`

## 📁 Files Modified

### **`.vercelignore`**
```diff
# Contract files (not needed for frontend deployment)
contracts/
- contract/
hardhat.config.cjs
```

## 🎯 Why This Fix Works

1. **Frontend Needs ABI**: The leaderboard and statistics pages import the contract ABI
2. **Selective Exclusion**: We exclude the `contracts/` directory (Hardhat contracts) but keep `contract/` (frontend ABI)
3. **Build Success**: Vercel can now find the required ABI file during build

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Redeploy to Vercel**: The build should now succeed
2. **Verify**: Check that the leaderboard and statistics pages work correctly
3. **Test**: Ensure all contract interactions function properly

## ✅ Ready for Deployment

Your project should now build and deploy successfully on Vercel with all required files included!
